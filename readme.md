**Basics**:

This is a very basic scraper-spider for those html books where there's a table of contents page that links to a bunch of sub-pages with actual content (like the documentation for a bunch of libraries).

Dependencies: Beautiful Soup 4 on Python 2.7.
 
It assumes all content is vanilla html or at least can be accessed through vanilla html.  

**Usage**:

`python spideyscrape.py [http://url/for/table_of_contents/toc.html]`

Run script from terminal (etc.), then pass the script a url to the table of contents (ToC) page through the prompt you get (or via a command line argument, thanks to a kind contribution from @cclauss). This script scrapes every unique page linked from the ToC and concatenates the contents of their html bodies into one big html page.
 
The point is to save those things for offline reading, for planes etc.  It targets [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) on iPad for optimum usefulness as offline reader, but also works fine on real computers.  On the iPad with Pythonista, probably the most useful way to invoke this script is by saving the following bookmarklet to Mobile Safari: 

    javascript:window.location='pythonista://spideyscrape.py?action=run&args='+window.location.href;

Then navigate to the ToC page you want to scrape and activate the bookmarklet.  

Please only scrape content with copyright terms that permit copying.  Be nice to writers.  The primary intended use of this is to scrape documents offered to the public under licenses that permit copying, but which are often distributed in clueless formats (such as the documentation for many open-source software packages, which is often provided under Creative Commons or MIT licenses, permitting scraping).

**Contributing**: 

PRs are welcome.  Go wild.  :-)  However, I'd like to keep this runnable on both Pythonista on iOS and full-sized computers, so please don't rely on any Pythonista-specific libraries (like the clipboard module) without also providing a fallback for big machines; likewise please don't rely on any libraries that can't be installed in Pythonista without providing a more vanilla fallback.  

**Future**: 

1.  Down the road, I'd like to extend to make it possible to specify a crawl depth to recursively scrape to, and figure out some sensible way to order the sub-pages in that context. 

2.  It would also be cool to download and include images embedded in the original page.  Right now absolute url images should work but relative url images will probably break (not tested).
